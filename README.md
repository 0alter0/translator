# Translator
This is my custom translator that uses Google Translate to translate stuff 100 times.

# Info
This isn't made with python or some sketchy .exe, it's not hard to use and very straight forward.

The difference between Full and Speed Mode is obviously one is faster than the other, but it uses less languages. Full mode uses most if not every language, while Speed mode uses the top 15 languages.

The more languages you use, the more time it takes for a translation, and it also becomes slower depending on how long your text is.

If you'd like to check what it has been translated into, open Inspect, and go into network.

# Todo

- [ ] Add seeds 
- [ ] Add legacy and new versions (currently on legacy) 
- [ ] Make new version not translate from one language to english, to another language, to english, etc... 
- [ ] Make bookmarklet version
