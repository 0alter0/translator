# Translator
This is my custom translator that uses Google Translate to translate stuff 100 times.

The main reason why I made this is because (like said in Info) most of these tools are weird .exes or python scripts that barely work. I've been researching Google Translate stuff for quite some time and I've made things like this, but they were slow, and most tools are.

This tool is actually decently fast, the old tool I used to use was HyperTranslate, which **was** very fast, 100 translations in 16 seconds, before it came extremely slow and took 3+ minutes for 100 translations. I hope you enjoy this tool, as I find it quite fun to mess around with.

# Info
This isn't made with python or some sketchy .exe, it's not hard to use and very straight forward.

The difference between Full and Speed Mode is obviously one is faster than the other, but it uses less languages. Full mode uses most if not every language, while Speed mode uses the top 15 languages.

The more languages you use, the more time it takes for a translation, and it also becomes slower depending on how long your text is.

If you'd like to check what it has been translated into, open Inspect, and go into network.

Difference between legacy and new? The difference is one (legacy) makes some decent amount of sense, while the other (new) is basically schizophrenic. The results are so bad, 9/10 you're gonna get something like "And then the jjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjJJJJJJJJJJJJJJ."

Yes, this is kinda funny, although I personally use Legacy Speed, as it's fast, makes sense, but still weird.

# Todo

- [x] Add seeds 
- [x] Add legacy and new versions (currently on legacy) 
- [x] Make new version not translate from one language to english, to another language, to english, etc... 
- [ ] Make bookmarklet version
