# Translator
This is my custom translator that uses Google Translate to translate stuff 100 times.

# Info
This isn't made with python or some sketchy .exe, it's not hard to use and very straight forward.

The difference between Full and Speed Mode is obviously one is faster than the other, but it uses less languages. Full mode uses most if not every language, while Speed mode uses the top 15 languages.

The more languages you use, the more time it takes for a translation, and it also becomes slower depending on how long your text is.

If you'd like to check what it has been translated into, open Inspect, and go into network.

Difference between legacy and new? The difference is one (legacy) makes some decent amount of sense, while the other (new) is basically schizophrenic. The results are so bad, 9/10 you're gonna get something like "And then the jjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjJJJJJJJJJJJJJJ."

Yes, this is kinda funny, although I personally use Legacy Speed, as it's fast, makes sense, but still weird.

# Todo

- [x] Add seeds 
- [x] Add legacy and new versions (currently on legacy) 
- [x] Make new version not translate from one language to english, to another language, to english, etc... 
- [ ] Make bookmarklet version

# Big Update
I'm not putting this in Todo because this one is a bit ambitious. Basically, I have an idea for an encryption system, inspired off my friend Cool Duck.

Basically, this will use the seed section that will translate a phrase a certain way, then there will be another text box which will undo it and give you the real meaning. Example: You translate "What the flippy" with the seed 69, the output is "What would you do," you give your friend the output and the seed, then your friend inputs the output and seed into a seperate box which it will then undo what the seed does, thus giving you the original text.
